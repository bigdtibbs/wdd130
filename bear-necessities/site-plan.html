      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I love animals, as does my daughter. We especially love dogs. Last year our beloved family dog, Bear, passed away. It's been a hard transition for our family, especially our oldest daughter. I asked her what I should do for this website project. Her response - Something for Spirit Bear. I've thought about her comment throughout the week. It's led me to do some research on canine website available in my area. While there are bits and pieces and resources available on other sites, there's not a single, definitive site that offers dog owners a place to go for information on local vets, dog parks, pet stores, and other resources. I want to create a website that will be this resource for local dog owners.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is dog owners within the Cache Valley, Utah area who have access to the internet and a computer or mobile device. These individuals will need to have a desire to find pet friendly parks, restaurants, and hiking trails, as well as other services such as veterinarians and groomers. If there is time and resources, I would like to have a section for resources for owners or family/friends of owners who have lost pets as well.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Welcome to Bear Necessities - A website where Cache Valley residents can find information about dog parks, veterinarians, pet shelters/kennels, and dog friendly restaurants - All in one place!
      </p>
      <p>
        Dog owner's love their four-pawed, furry companions. We sure loved our rescue dog. He was a central part of our family for thirteen years before health conditions took him from our family. His name was Bear, which is where “Bear” in “Bear Necessities” comes from. We often looked for pet friendly places where he could accompany us on our adventures, as well as the best veterinarians (especially the last few months of his life). It's our hope that this site offers those resources to others in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dog doesn't need much; A loving family, something to chew on, and a place to stretch their legs and sniff a friendly canine or two are really the 'necessities'. As Cache Valley continues to grow, resources are being used to build parks dedicated to our canine companions, as well as trails that they are welcome to join us for a stroll on. Businesses are also becoming more welcome to on-leash policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are glad that you found our little corner here on the www's, and for those of you from our neck of the woods, we hope you find the information here useful. Those of you not from Cache Valley - Look around! You might find something you like. The Veterinary Page has some helpful links about pet loss (coping, veterinary financing, gifts for grieving friends). Whoever you are, thank you for visiting, and from my daughter, “Dad, ask people to pet their 'Bear-dog' for me.”

        <i>“A dog has no use for fancy cares, big homes, or designer clothes. A waterlogged stick will do just fine.”</i> - John Grogan <i>Marley and Me</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experience with dog parks in Cache Valley started over a decade ago. Back then, it seems that Rendezvous Park had the only official off-leash dog park in Cache Valley (which was nothing more than an open field next to the highway and railroad tracks, but it had wonderful access to Logan River). In fact, we often found unofficial spots along rivers, canals, and reservoirs in the area where we could enjoy time with our dog without interfering with, and interference from, others.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, the city council for Logan City passed a resolution to temporarily give off-leash access to a handful of city parks. This one-year experiment was to determine if dog owners could responsibly use city property with their pets and, if so, which city parks could be extended permanent dog park status. In-spite of the pandemic and the greater-than-anticipated numbers of people participating the experiment was a success for dog owners. All but one of the parks in the experiment were given permanent off-leash status (the one exception being Logan Meadows Park, which has no fences and backs into several private home properties). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you will find information on each off-leash dog park in Cache Valley. We hope you and your furry friends will enjoy your time at as few or as many of them as you care to try out. Please remember the successful nature of the Logan City experiment and the rewards that come from all of us being responsible pet owners. Please remember to clean up after your pet, keep an eye on them at all times, and most of all - Have fun!

        From puppy to old dog, our canine friends will have changing medical needs. Choosing a veterinarian can be as simple as “who is closest to us”, or a much more difficult decision. Here you will find links to each veterinarian in each city in Cache Valley. Additionally, there are resources for those whose four-legged friends have passed on.
