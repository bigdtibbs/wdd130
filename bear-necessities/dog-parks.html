                        Our experience with dog parks in Cache Valley started over a decade ago. Back then, it seems that Rendezvous Park had the only official off-leash dog park in Cache Valley (which was nothing more than an open field next to the highway and railroad tracks, but it had wonderful access to Logan River). In fact, we often found unofficial spots along rivers, canals, and reservoirs in the area where we could enjoy time with our dog without interfering with, and interference from, others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, the city council for Logan City passed a resolution to temporarily give off-leash access to a handful of city parks. This one-year experiment was to determine if dog owners could responsibly use city property with their pets and, if so, which city parks could be extended permanent dog park status. In-spite of the pandemic and the greater-than-anticipated numbers of people participating the experiment was a success for dog owners. All but one of the parks in the experiment were given permanent off-leash status (the one exception being Logan Meadows Park, which has no fences and backs into several private home properties). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here you will find information on each off-leash dog park in Cache Valley. We hope you and your furry friends will enjoy your time at as few or as many of them as you care to try out. Please remember the successful nature of the Logan City experiment and the rewards that come from all of us being responsible pet owners. Please remember to clean up after your pet, keep an eye on them at all times, and most of all - Have fun!
