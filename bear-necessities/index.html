                        Welcome to Bear Necessities - A website where Cache Valley residents can find information about dog parks, veterinarians, pet shelters/kennels, and dog friendly restaurants - All in one place!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dog owner's love their four-pawed, furry companions. We sure loved our rescue dog. He was a central part of our family for thirteen years before health conditions took him from our family. His name was Bear, which is where “Bear” in “Bear Necessities” comes from. We often looked for pet friendly places where he could accompany us on our adventures, as well as the best veterinarians (especially the last few months of his life). It's our hope that this site offers those resources to others in the area.

                        A dog doesn't need much; A loving family, something to chew on, and a place to stretch their legs and sniff a friendly canine or two are really the 'necessities'. As Cache Valley continues to grow, resources are being used to build parks dedicated to our canine companions, as well as trails that they are welcome to join us for a stroll on. Businesses are also becoming more welcome to on-leash policies.

                        We are glad that you found our little corner here on the www's, and for those of you from our neck of the woods, we hope you find the information here useful. Those of you not from Cache Valley - Look around! You might find something you like. The Veterinary Page has some helpful links about pet loss (coping, veterinary financing, gifts for grieving friends). Whoever you are, thank you for visiting, and from my daughter, “Dad, ask people to pet their 'Bear-dog' for me.”
