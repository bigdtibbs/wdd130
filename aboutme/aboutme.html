    <h2>Nickname: D</h2>
    <p>I enjoy working in my yard, gardening, spendning time with my family, snowmobiling and
        playing basketball. I've been married for 14 years or so. We have one daughter that's five
        years old and another daughter due in May.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a bachelors degree in software engineering through BYU - Idaho. I started the Pathways Program in
        2016 and will hopefully
        be wrapping it all up in December of this year. I've enjoyed learning web development
        throughout my path and have found it quite useful.</p>
    <p>Last week I worked with our IT group to request some CSS changes to our RMA system to help our Shipping
        department more easily
        see which courier to use when processing a repair. Web development is a wonderful ability
        to have a working knowledge of and it's fun to do.
